PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker to automate the build process for a Python application. The CI pipeline is part of a comprehensive CI/CD workflow aimed at achieving efficient and reliable software delivery.

KEY MILESTONES AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
1. Jenkins Setup:
Installed and configured Jenkins within a Docker container.
Secured Jenkins by creating a dedicated user and granting necessary permissions.

2. Source Code Management:
Created a Jenkins job to monitor a GitHub repository for changes.
Configured Jenkins to trigger builds based on scheduled polling of the GitHub repository.

3. Build Process:
Configured Jenkins to build the application using a Docker image defined in a Dockerfile.
Integrated version control to ensure consistency and reproducibility of builds.

4. Integration with GitHub:
Set up a local Git repository and pushed the application code and related files to a remote GitHub repository.

5. Docker Image Cleanup:
Implemented a Docker command to clean up the image repository, ensuring a clean environment for each build.

6. Simulated Changes and Build Monitoring:
Simulated changes in the GitHub repository to trigger automated builds.
Monitored build progress through Jenkins console output.
Ensured successful integration and image creation.

7. GitHub Repository and Version Control:
Created a GitHub repository to host the application code and related files.
Utilized Git commands to initialize the repository, commit changes, and push to GitHub.

SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:
Continuous Integration
Jenkins Configuration
